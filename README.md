# Abstract/Introduction
E-Drugstore Administration is an efficient and user-friendly system designed to manage medical items and medicine details. The system is categorized to enable easy access and search of specific medicines based on their labels. For instance, if there are different types of medicine for a particular ailment, such as Disprin and Panadol, they will be listed under the appropriate label for easy retrieval. The system is capable of providing customers with information about the price and quantity of the required medicine.

The E-Drugstore Administration system offers an opportunity for staff members to sign up as administrators and gain full access to maintain daily records. The system is developed for a windows-based application to ensure that all operations are fast and straightforward. The user interface is designed to be easy to use for all types of users, including salespersons who may not have advanced qualifications. Moreover, the system provides a report generation facility that enables staff to obtain hard copies of reports detailing the sales and purchase of drugstore items.

The e-Drugstore Administration system has two types of users, namely Administrators, and Users. Administrators have full access to the system to manage daily records, while users have limited access to search for medical items and view related information. The system is designed to be efficient and easy to use, enabling drugstore staff to manage medical items and medicine details effectively.
